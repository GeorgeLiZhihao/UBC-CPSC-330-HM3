    "1. **What is the problem with calling `fit_transform` on your test data with `StandardScaler`?**  \n",
    "   Calling `fit_transform` on the test set makes `StandardScaler` compute the mean and standard deviation using test data, which introduces *data leakage*. This violates the requirement that the test set remain unseen during training and preprocessing, and it can lead to overly optimistic and unreliable evaluation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why is it important to follow the Golden Rule? If you violate it, will that give you a worse classifier?**  \n",
    "   The Golden Rule ensures that no information from the test set is used during training, preprocessing, or model selection, which preserves an unbiased estimate of generalization performance. Violating it does not necessarily produce a worse classifier, but it typically inflates reported performance and makes the evaluation misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are two advantages of using sklearn Pipelines?**  \n",
    "   First, Pipelines reduce the risk of leakage by fitting preprocessing steps only on the training data and applying the same transformations consistently to validation/test data. Second, they improve reproducibility and workflow clarity by combining preprocessing and modeling into a single object that supports cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When is it appropriate to use sklearn `ColumnTransformer`?**  \n",
    "   `ColumnTransformer` is appropriate when different feature groups require different preprocessing (e.g., scaling numeric features while one-hot encoding categorical features). It applies these transformations in parallel and produces a single combined feature matrix that integrates cleanly with sklearn Pipelines."
